Perfect selection! ✅ Those are all excellent choices for text extraction and chunking:

Your list:

TXT (easiest)

CSV (structured text)

PDF (need pdf-parse)

JSON (structured)

XML (structured)

MD (markdown)

DOCX (need mammoth)

PPTX (need office-text-extractor)

Great for RAG - all extract text cleanly and chunk well! 🚀
