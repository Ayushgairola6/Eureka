> **Beyond Semantic Search:** An Agentic RAG pipeline that combines deterministic function calling, multi-document synthesis, and live web verification to eliminate hallucinations.

## 🏗️ The Problem: The "Black Box" of AI

Standard RAG systems blindly inject vector chunks into a context window, leading to "Generative Guessing." **AntiNode** bridges the gap between neural generation and symbolic retrieval.

### Core Architecture:

1.  **Agentic Router:** Analyzes intent to determine if the user needs a private file, a deep web crawl, or a logic audit.
2.  **Symbolic Tools:** Executes deterministic functions (e.g., `searchByName`) to retrieve exact financial or code data.
3.  **Collaborative Synthesis:** Multi-agent processing that cross-references private "Vault" data against live web standards.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📂 Multi-Doc RAG Vault:** Securely upload and chat with PDFs, TXTs, and Code files.
- **🌐 Live Web Synthesis:** Real-time fact-verification against the live internet using Deep Research agents.
- **🤝 Collaborative Workspaces:** Create "Rooms" with public/private visibility for team-based research.
- **🧠 Neuro-Symbolic Audit:** A "Think before you speak" architecture that audits code and logic before responding.
- **📱 Hybrid PWA:** A touch-optimized, Arctic Neon interface available on mobile and desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core AI:** Google Gemini 1.5 Pro (Logic) + Flash (Intent)
- **Vector DB:** Pinecone (Serverless)
- **Database:** Supabase (Auth & Usage Quotas)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Express (Custom RAG Pipelines)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + TailwindCSS

> **Author's Note:** AntiNode was built to solve the "Black Box" problem of AI. By exposing the _Process_ (the function calls, the sources, the logic checks), we turn AI from a magic trick into a reliable engineering tool.
